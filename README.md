# Introduction to Tensorflow2.0 with Python
### About this Repo
* The first part of the project was to learn [Tensorflow2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials).
I followed the tutorial given by [Nour Islam Mokhtari](https://aifee.teachable.com/).
So, i you are interested in the work or want to learn Tensorflow, make sure to check him out.<br>
* The Second part of the repo is to reproduce the work given by [CHRIS DEOTTE](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte), where he posted a great article about [How to choose CNN Architecture MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/code/cdeotte/how-to-choose-cnn-architecture-mnist/notebook#5.-Advanced-features) on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/).<br> 
Here I chose several models mentioned in this article and create a comparison chart in regard of the validation accuracy. For more details, make sure to check it out if you are interested.<br>
